Just so you know, I've been a WordPress **user**, **admin**, and **plugin author** for around a decade now. I could've set this up as yet another one of those ubiquitous [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) pages. This time, however, I'm taking a different approach. [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) is my tool of choice as [I'm a DevSecOps Advisor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markcheret), leaning into [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and of course the automation behind this declarative setup. So here it comes... Yet another steep learning curve for me and a completely new piece of technology to embrace and use. That's the spirit :)

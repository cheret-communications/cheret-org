On 18/09/2019 I registered a domain called popcorn-science.com. I'm giving you a teaser here.

I have been running my first few experiments to gather some data to present some results to the public very soon. There is also a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqXBpWF4y_ph2L2qURKbAg), which is void of any content at the time of writing. Progress has been hampered due to funding issues. We're working on a campaign to ensure smooth operation. In the meantime, please direct your kind [donations to the project here](https://bunq.me/popcornscience). Keep you posted.

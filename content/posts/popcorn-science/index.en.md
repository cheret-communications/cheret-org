Some call me the "Popcorn Pope". My popcorn creations are imaginative, tasty and far from the plain old bland popped corn.

So, to take you with me on this marvelous journey, I registered a domain on 18/09/2019 called popcorn-science.com. I'm giving you a teaser here.

I have been running my first few experiments to gather some data to present some results to the public very soon. There is also a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjqXBpWF4y_ph2L2qURKbAg), which is void of any content at the time of writing. Progress has been hampered due to funding issues. We're working on a campaign to ensure smooth operation. In the meantime, please direct your kind [donations to the project here](https://bunq.me/popcornscience). Keep you posted.

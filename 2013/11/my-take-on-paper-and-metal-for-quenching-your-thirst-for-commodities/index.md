Well guess what: that can be done without the need for paper. Take plastic. Painless, simple, effective, trustworthy. Now come the guys claiming that plastic is a security nightmare. Ever been hacked when buying online? Well. The exact same problem exists with your piles of paper. If anybody decided they wanted your belongings, well, they will find means to accomplish just that. Others will tell me that currency is a fragile thing and the circulating banknotes receive trust and are equal to whatever their government has in real value stored in some vaults or invested in real estate and all that makes the foundation of our economy. Foundations ought to be shaken from time to time. If you cannot trust in what is in your bank account then who do you trust? In greenish-blue banknotes? Look at you… to be continued…..

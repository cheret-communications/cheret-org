The original sketch gets lost in a bunch of C's, S's and infinity symbols. I accepted the challenge and started doodling some quick outlines on a piece of paper that was already filled with some freehand drawing exercises.
Highlighted outlines and cropped in. Highlighted with a Uni-ball Gel Impact Black Broad 1.</description></item><item><title>Squiggly Lines</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/12/squiggly-lines/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 21:10:00 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/12/squiggly-lines/</guid><description>Input I wanted to exercise my blending techniques, depth, perspective and shading work, so I just pencilled a few lines on a blank piece of paper and went from there.
Initial sketch. Process Finished artwork with all the supplies used to create it. I coloured the main lines and blended them using Polychromos and filled the gaps between them with Albrecht Dürer Watercolour.
The supplies depicted in the above image are:</description></item><item><title>Hearts on Fire</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/10/hearts-on-fire/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:00 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/10/hearts-on-fire/</guid><description>Input This Hearts on Fire project started as a study I sketched of a heart. I envisioned it to be an intricate piece with loads of details.
The original piece was created layering a bunch of colours. What started as a sketch with thin lines and a mis-shaped heart quickly turned into something a bit more clunky. However, I started to take a liking to this happy accident and decided to roll with it, adding further shades into the mix and extending the borders of the heart further and further.</description></item><item><title>Princess, Queen &amp; Goddess</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/10/princess-queen-goddess/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 17:37:00 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/10/princess-queen-goddess/</guid><description>This project is only one piece of an ongoing larger creative framing.
There will be an article on my coaching website about my theory of the origins of sexual attraction. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the polarity both in the expression of masculinity versus femininity as well as the components of healed versus wounded and how the magnitude of this magnetic force is amplified by how far removed from a central pole both parties are.</description></item><item><title>Art supply craze</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/09/art-supply-craze/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 19:28:00 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/09/art-supply-craze/</guid><description>The art supply craze has officially begun. I&amp;rsquo;m all in learning to work with colour and find creative expression using blank sheets of paper and some pencils. I massively fell in love with the handling and colour of the Polychromos colour pencils and discovered them as a fantastic tool for an artist. So I went and got myself a beautiful extension to the palette of available colours and some tools for sketching for my kid.</description></item><item><title>Sketchbook: Rainbow, Dark forest &amp; Double stars</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/09/sketchbook-rainbow-dark-forest-double-stars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 23:03:00 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/09/sketchbook-rainbow-dark-forest-double-stars/</guid><description>This is my first drawing entry for my sketchbook. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my progress as an artist publicly as a function of accountability for myself.
Being inspired to pick up drawing by an idea for a collage that came to my head while I was in deep thought about present and future of my love relationship, I went out and bought some top quality art supplies to fuel the creative process.</description></item><item><title>Functional Sculpture: Podium</title><link>https://cheret.org/2021/05/functional-sculpture-podium/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 May 2021 09:47:17 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2021/05/functional-sculpture-podium/</guid><description>This podium is a functional sculpture. It was fashioned Bricolage-style from the scraps of building an original sound stage frame made out of 100x100mm pieces of spruce construction wood and a panel from an IKEA shelf system.
I thought of the concept, collected the material and a carpenter friend of mine assembled the pieces, making use of his woodworking equipment, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have at the time. The foot is made out of 4 wood pieces of equal length, bolted together in pairs.</description></item><item><title>Popcorn Science Update</title><link>https://cheret.org/2021/04/popcorn-science-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Apr 2021 18:25:49 +0000</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2021/04/popcorn-science-update/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Some call me the &ldquo;Popcorn Pope&rdquo;.

This of course was to be expected of a vote with the potential of having wide ranging consequences. I&rsquo;d like to call a lot of what&rsquo;s been going on merely &ldquo;noise&rdquo; while trying to distil the essence of it which I&rsquo;d like to call &ldquo;signal&rdquo;.]]></description></item><item><title>LBPC#042 - Bergmuffel</title><link>https://cheret.org/2015/06/lbpc-042-bergmuffel/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 15:27:44 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2015/06/lbpc-042-bergmuffel/</guid><description>LBPC#042 - Bergmuffel Die geilsten Berge der Welt vor der Nase und fast nie oben?

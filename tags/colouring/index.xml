The original sketch gets lost in a bunch of C's, S's and infinity symbols. I accepted the challenge and started doodling some quick outlines on a piece of paper that was already filled with some freehand drawing exercises.
Highlighted outlines and cropped in. Highlighted with a Uni-ball Gel Impact Black Broad 1.</description></item><item><title>Hearts on Fire</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/10/hearts-on-fire/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:00 +0100</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/10/hearts-on-fire/</guid><description>Input This Hearts on Fire project started as a study I sketched of a heart.

There will be an article on my coaching website about my theory of the origins of sexual attraction. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the polarity both in the expression of masculinity versus femininity as well as the components of healed versus wounded and how the magnitude of this magnetic force is amplified by how far removed from a central pole both parties are.</description></item></channel></rss>

It was fashioned Bricolage-style from the scraps of building an original sound stage frame made out of 100x100mm pieces of spruce construction wood and a panel from an IKEA shelf system.
I thought of the concept, collected the material and a carpenter friend of mine assembled the pieces, making use of his woodworking equipment, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t have at the time. The foot is made out of 4 wood pieces of equal length, bolted together in pairs.</description></item></channel></rss>

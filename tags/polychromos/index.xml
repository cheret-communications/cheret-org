I&amp;rsquo;m all in learning to work with colour and find creative expression using blank sheets of paper and some pencils. I massively fell in love with the handling and colour of the Polychromos colour pencils and discovered them as a fantastic tool for an artist. So I went and got myself a beautiful extension to the palette of available colours and some tools for sketching for my kid.</description></item><item><title>Sketchbook: Rainbow, Dark forest &amp; Double stars</title><link>https://cheret.org/2022/09/sketchbook-rainbow-dark-forest-double-stars/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Sep 2022 23:03:00 +0200</pubDate><author>cheret.en</author><guid>https://cheret.org/2022/09/sketchbook-rainbow-dark-forest-double-stars/</guid><description>This is my first drawing entry for my sketchbook. I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my progress as an artist publicly as a function of accountability for myself.
Being inspired to pick up drawing by an idea for a collage that came to my head while I was in deep thought about present and future of my love relationship, I went out and bought some top quality art supplies to fuel the creative process.</description></item></channel></rss>

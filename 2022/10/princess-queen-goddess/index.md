# Princess, Queen & Goddess


This project is only one piece of an ongoing larger creative framing.

There will be an article on my [coaching website](https://cheret.de) about my theory of the origins of sexual attraction. It's all about the polarity both in the expression of masculinity versus femininity as well as the components of healed versus wounded and how the magnitude of this magnetic force is amplified by how far removed from a central pole both parties are.

I created a schematic in my sketchbook and showed it to my kid. Telling her that an example for a healed feminine with a high level of energy could be a queen and one with even more could be a goddess. She was inspired and sketched out princess, queen, goddess and god. She then passed the sketch on to me and I coloured it with my new kit of [Faber-Castell 24 Polychromos Colour Pencils](https://www.faber-castell.de/produkte/PolychromosFarbstift24erMetalletui/110024).

I started colouring while on vacation in Croatia ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡· using the [Faber-Castell 24 Classic Colour Pencils](https://www.faber-castell.de/produkte/ClassicColoursRadierbareBuntstifte24erKartonetui/116625) while my kid was journalling.

When I started using the [Faber-Castell 24 Polychromos Colour Pencils](https://www.faber-castell.de/produkte/PolychromosFarbstift24erMetalletui/110024), this project became my test subject to get familiar with the tool. I'm very pleased with the end result. Especially keeping in mind that this was the first project I have finished using a new tool.

I'm very impressed with the saturation of all colours in the spectrum and the handling of the Polychromos Colour Pencils takes some getting used to, specifically when you want to squeeze all the performance out of them.  After the initial learning curve I'm delighted to have stumbled upon these pencils and have since moved on to acquire two full sets of 120 and one with 60.

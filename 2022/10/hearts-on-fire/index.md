# Hearts on Fire


## Input

This Hearts on Fire project started as a study I sketched of a heart. I envisioned it to be an intricate piece with loads of details.

What started as a sketch with thin lines and a mis-shaped heart quickly turned into something a bit more clunky. However, I started to take a liking to this happy accident and decided to roll with it, adding further shades into the mix and extending the borders of the heart further and further.

## Process

I posted this image on a slack channel of the company I work for and got some feedback from people. One kind soul volunteered to lend me a coffee table book with a few variations on the heart theme for inspiration and I gladly took her up on the offer. The original piece was decidedly missing some flames while bearing "on fire" in the title. So I fixed that by using some brushes and odourless mineral spirits to move the pigments vaguely depicting flames.

I'm quite happy with how this project turned out. I take it as a nice study of how to work with the [Faber-Castell 60 Polychromos Colour Pencils](https://www.faber-castell.de/produkte/PolychromosFarbstift60erMetalletui/110060) and learned quite a few techniques along the way. Most of it I picked up watching some YouTube content on the subject matter.

# welcome to cheret.org

This public repository contains the cheret.org website which is built using the HUGO templating system and static webpage generator.

This website houses all my public artistic expressions, private opinions, media I have produced and everything else that doesn't fit on my "for profit" websites.

It's more or less my public playing ground for "doing what I say", whereas cheret.de and cheret.tech are more like "saying what I do" if that makes sense.

It's a mixture of English, German and content in other languages. You have been warned.
